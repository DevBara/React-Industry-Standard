                  Can international human rights help guide and govern artificial intelligence (AI)?
                  Currently, much of society is uncertain about the real human impacts of AI systems.
                  Amid hopes that AI can bring forth “global good” there is evidence that some AI systems are already violating fundamental rights and freedoms. 
                  As stakeholders look for a North Star to guide AI development, we can rely on human rights to help chart the course ahead. 
                  International human rights are a powerful tool for identifying, preventing, and redressing an important class of risks and harms. 
                  A human rights-based frame could provide those developing AI with the aspirational, normative, and legal 
                  guidance to uphold human dignity and the inherent worth of every individual regardless of country or jurisdiction. Simply put:
                  In order for AI to benefit the common good, at the very least its design and deployment should avoid harms to fundamental human
                  values. International human rights provide a robust and global formulation of those values.

                     Those working on technology policy are faced with the difficult task of deciding what standards, values, or norms to 
                     apply in different social contexts. They need to balance the tradeoffs of developing or deploying technologies. 
                     They need to understand the potential misuses and abuses, unintended consequences, biases in sociotechnical systems, 
                     and even the costs of not deploying a tool when it may help someone in need. 
                     Human rights provide those working on AI with a basis for understanding why governing systems – 
                     from technical standards to policy – should address values like nondiscrimination in the first place. 
                     This is important for tech companies whose products will be used across national borders where laws and values vary.
